# =====  ppr-api ======================================================================================================

# The IMS API is not exposed from the cluster using a route, so it needs to be port forwarded:
#
#     $ oc -n zwmtib-dev port-forward ims-api-XX-XXXXX 8888:8080 &
#
PPR_API_IMS_API_URL=http://localhost:8888

# Allowed origins for cors. Provide a space separated list of urls.

# The sentry.io Data Source Name for the project. For local development this should always be blank, to prevent the
# logging (and emailing) of errors. However it can be temporarily set when working with sentry itself.
#
PPR_API_SENTRY_DSN=

# The sentry.io environment for the project. For local development this should be something unique-ish, like your
# username.
#
PPR_API_SENTRY_ENVIRONMENT=local.development


# =====  docker-compose ===============================================================================================

# To facilitate running dependencies on your local workstation, there is a docker-compose.yml in the root project
# directory.  Docker Compose also uses .env files, but requires them to be in the directory where you run the command.

# This value should be the same as 'PPR_API_DB_PASSWORD'
DB_PASSWORD=password
