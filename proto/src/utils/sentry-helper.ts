            If you want to preserve this functionality, make sure to pass the logErrors: true option.

If capturing too much data and need to filter see
https://docs.sentry.io/error-reporting/configuration/filtering/?platform=browser
and add a filter like this
Sentry.init({

    if (event.user) {
      // Don't send user's email address
      delete event.user.email;

To add context data such as user information, tags, event levels, etc see
https://docs.sentry.io/enriching-error-data/context/?platform=browser
Sentry.configureScope(function(scope) {
  scope.setUser({"email": "john.doe@example.com"});
