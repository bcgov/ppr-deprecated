# PPR Vue CLI & Create

This project was created using the Vue CLI and the create command.  

To run Vue CLI UI from the vcli subfolder 
```shell script
cd vcli
node  node_modules/@vue/cli/bin/vue.js ui
```

If there comes a time when we wish to update this Vue client then we recommend the following process.

## Setup Vue CLI - local
Create a subdirectory '''vcli'''
```shell script
mkdir vcli
```
Prepare the directory as a node project
```shell script
cd vcli
npm install
```
Install the latest Vue CLI
```shell script
npm install  @vue/cli â€”save
```

## Create a Vue project
Then run the local copy of the Vue CLI to create the project.
```shell script
node  node_modules/@vue/cli/bin/vue.js create sample-client
```
