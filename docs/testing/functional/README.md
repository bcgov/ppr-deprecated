# Functional Testing Checklist

The following list of items should be considered when doing functional tests.
Mind you that this list can and will be enhanced.

For definition and general strategy for functional testing please see [Functional test Strategy](https://github.com/bcgov/ppr/blob/master/docs/test-strategy/teststrategy.md#FunctionalTestStrategy).

## Types of checklists

Below are some initial checklists for different aspects of the system under test. It is expected that checklists will grow and will take on more context. Checklists are an excellent way of capturing corporate knowledge and bringing tacit knowledge to the foreground.

### Specification-based testing:

**User Stories**

- [ ] Test if the story complete (All needed acceptance criteria, captures the essence of the activity)
- [ ] Test if the story identifies the actors and the goal?
- [ ] Test if it is clear what this story is part of?
- [ ] Test if the system supports fullfilling this story?
- [ ] Test if guidance provided by the system in alignment with the user story goal?

**Functional Acceptance Criteria**

- [ ] Test Happy Path - Meets minimum requirement
- [ ] Negative testing - Will not allow for invalid usage/input
- [ ] Test Boundaries of input - (max/min values and ranges)
- [ ] Test data variants and outlier/rare data scenarios
- [ ] Review alignment with other acceptance criteria for the story under test
- [ ] Review completeness of acceptance criteria
- [ ] Review acceptance criteria applicability for different roles

**Business Process**

- [ ] Test if the business process logical and supported by the system?
- [ ] Test variations in process (exceptions, errors, incomplete information)?
- [ ] Test how the business process as supported by the system aligns with the manual processes like printing, off-system look ups, approvals, escalation etc.?

**Security role validation**

- [ ] Test access and visibility as per provided security matrix
- [ ] Identify missing roles, excessive access, too little access
- [ ] Test intentionally doing activities that the role should not be able to
- [ ] Test running transactions as different roles
