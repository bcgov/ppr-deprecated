# Developer Notes

## Python Virtual Environment

This information below is taken from the [VS Code Documentation](#https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/python/environments). Refer to it for clarification or to expand your knowledge.

After pulling down the PPR repository, open the `/ppr-api` directory in VS Code. You will want to install python package in a virtual environment, rather than in the global installation:

```
$ python3 -m venv .venv
```

Popup: "We noticed a new virtual environment has been created. Do you want to select it for the workspace folder?" (`Yes`, and choose the .venv one)

Popup: "Linter pylint is not installed." (`Install`)

Ensure the command line prompt starts with something like `(.venv)`, otherwise ... (TBD: how to activate?).

## Installing Development Requirements

```
$ pip3 install -r requirements/dev.txt
```

This will install what is needed to run in VS Code. Note that there will be errors regarding an invalid command 'bdist_wheel', but these don't appear to be a problem.

## Start the Web Service

```
$ uvicorn app.main:app --reload
```

This should bring the web service up on http://localhost:8000, with OpenAPI documentation available at http://localhost:8000/docs.
